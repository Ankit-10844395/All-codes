Type of instances
1> on demand instance :- more costly
2> reserved instance :-less costly for Linux


--------------------------------->Reserved instance 

spot requests are not used for production - bidding - without intimation, aws terminates it 
changing sec group -> create new one ->outbound rule -> ssh -22 -> http -80 -> create


revise
create instance
volume will be attached initially










































how to mount using s3 fuse system to same platform ?
